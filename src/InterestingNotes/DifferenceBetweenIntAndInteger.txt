Can an int be null in Java?

    For example:

    int data = check(Node root);

    if ( data == null ) {
     // do something
    } else {
     // do something
    }

ANSWER:

    `int` can't be null, but `Integer` can.
    You need to be careful when unboxing null Integers since this can cause a lot of confusion and head scratching!

    E.g.

    int a = object.getA(); // getA returns a null Integer
    will give you a NullPointerException, despite object not being null!

    Only object references can be null, not primitives(int,string, bool, etc).

    So if you want to declare a null to int variable which is going to be int use Integer

    1. Integer candidate = null;  // correct
    2. int candidate = null  // wrong

    If you try to compile above (2) you will receive following error.

        error: incompatible types: <null> cannot be converted to int
